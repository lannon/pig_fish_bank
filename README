== Pig Fish Bank

Basic ATM application build on Rails with few dependencies and a number of
simplifying assumptions:

* Customers are authenticated by name and 4 digit numeric PIN
* Customer name must be unique
* This ATM is the lone ATM operated by Pig Fish Bank
* All customer Accounts are with Pig Fish Bank
* Customers can make deposits, withdrawal funds, transfer balances 
  and inquire about balances
* Customers are locked out of system after any three unsuccessful login 
  attempts
* Accounts cannot be overdrawn
* Existence of an admin tool that allows for PIN management, reporting, etc.
* Since there is only one ATM, we won't have to worry about DB locking or
  race conditions
